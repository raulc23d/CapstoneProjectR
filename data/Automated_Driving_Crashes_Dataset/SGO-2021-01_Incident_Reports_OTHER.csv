The vehicle made an abrupt shift to the left causing the vehicle to hit several orange construction barrels in the area impacting the left side of the vehicle.
The customer was not injured as a result of this incident.
A subsequent inspection by Volvo revealed that the windshield was replaced on June [XXX], 2021 however the ASDM (module integral in the functionality of Pilot Assist) was not calibrated after the installation as recommended by Volvo.  
Additionally a Sun Pass toll transponder mount was found beneath the collision avoidance systems on the upper portion of the windscreen.  Within the Owners Manual, Volvo strongly recommends not to mount any electronic device near that area as it may cause an adverse effect or impact functionality of the collision avoidance/Driver assistance system.
As the ASDM was not calibrated after the windscreen replacement and evidence of use of an electronic transponder, Volvo considers this item as closed."," "

The 2021MY Kia K5 was traveling northbound on [XXX], in the inside lane approaching the Chevrolet Impala. A 2008MY Honda Civic was traveling northbound on [XXX] in the inside lane behind the Kia K5.  Subsequently, the Kia K5's front struck the Chevrolet Impala's drivers side rear door and rear quarter panel.  After impact, the Impala traveled in a northwesterly, counterclockwise direction into a concrete barrier wall and bounced off the barrier wall and redirected to a northeasterly counterclockwise direction across the northbound lanes when the Honda Civic's front collided into the Chevrolet Impala's and left rear door.  The Chevrolet Impala came to rest facing north, blocking the inside lane. After impact, the Kia K5 traveled in a northeasterly direction across the northbound lanes and came to a final rest on the outside grass shoulder facing west.  The Honda Civic came to final rest blocking the outside lane adjacent to the Chevrolet Impala.  The subject Kia K5 is equipped with Highway Driving Assist (HDA).  HDA is a supplemental system that helps maintain a set distance and speed from the vehicle ahead when driving on a highway and helps keep the vehicle between lanes while driving.  HDA may not be able to recognize all traffic situations and may not detect possible collisions due to limitations of the system.  Obstacles such as vehicles, motorcycles, bicycles, pedestrians, unspecified objects and structures that may collide with the vehicle may not be detected. The owner (father of the driver) of the Kia K5 contacted Kia's Consumer Affairs Department on August [XXX], 2021 indicating that his son was involved in an accident.  The father was not a passenger or witness to the accident.  The father reported that HDA was engaged at the time of the incident and stated that his son ""had the autopilot on and there was a vehicle in the middle of the road and it [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION] did not notify his son.""  According to the father, the police removed the ""black box"" from the vehicle.  The claims made by the driver's father have not yet been confirmed, and we note that the subject vehicle has no ""autopilot"" nor does Kia America advertise any ADAS feature as ""autopilot.""  Kia has no further information at this time.**9/[XXX]/2021 - No incremental information available as of 9/[XXX]/2021 2:26PM (PDT)"," "

GM's current understanding of the crash is based on OnStar telematics data and the driver's statements after the crash to an OnStar representative.   Before the crash, the vehicle was proceeding straight on a freeway road with Super Cruise engaged.  The driver reported to OnStar that the cause of the crash was his inadvertent contact with the steering wheel that occurred when he bent down to pick something up off the floor of the vehicle.  This is consistent with telematics data, which indicates that the driver provided a manual override input into the steering wheel approximately four seconds before the crash.  This steering wheel input simultaneously disengaged Super Cruise and caused the sequence of events that led to the vehicle crashing into a fixed on-road barrier.  Super Cruise was not active at the time of the crash.  After the Crash, OnStar Emergency contacted the driver and found out the driver was alert and responsive, and requested emergency assistance.  GM believes, but has not confirmed, that the vehicle was towed from the scene.  Telematics data indicates that the driver was not belted at the time of the crash.

The 2021MY Kia K5 was traveling northbound on [XXX], in the inside lane approaching the Chevrolet Impala. A 2008MY Honda Civic was traveling northbound on [XXX] in the inside lane behind the Kia K5.  Subsequently, the Kia K5's front struck the Chevrolet Impala's drivers side rear door and rear quarter panel.  After impact, the Impala traveled in a northwesterly, counterclockwise direction into a concrete barrier wall and bounced off the barrier wall and redirected to a northeasterly counterclockwise direction across the northbound lanes when the Honda Civic's front collided into the Chevrolet Impala's and left rear door.  The Chevrolet Impala came to rest facing north, blocking the inside lane. After impact, the Kia K5 traveled in a northeasterly direction across the northbound lanes and came to a final rest on the outside grass shoulder facing west.  The Honda Civic came to final rest blocking the outside lane adjacent to the Chevrolet Impala.  The subject Kia K5 is equipped with Highway Driving Assist (HDA).  HDA is a supplemental system that helps maintain a set distance and speed from the vehicle ahead when driving on a highway and helps keep the vehicle between lanes while driving.  HDA may not be able to recognize all traffic situations and may not detect possible collisions due to limitations of the system.  Obstacles such as vehicles, motorcycles, bicycles, pedestrians, unspecified objects and structures that may collide with the vehicle may not be detected. The owner (father of the driver) of the Kia K5 contacted Kia's Consumer Affairs Department on August [XXX], 2021 indicating that his son was involved in an accident.  The father was not a passenger or witness to the accident.  The father reported that HDA was engaged at the time of the incident and stated that his son ""had the autopilot on and there was a vehicle in the middle of the road and it [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION] did not notify his son.""  According to the father, the police removed the ""black box"" from the vehicle.  The claims made by the driver's father have not yet been confirmed, and we note that the subject vehicle has no ""autopilot"" nor does Kia America advertise any ADAS feature as ""autopilot.""  Kia has no further information at this time.**9/[XXX]/2021 - No incremental information available as of 9/[XXX]/2021 2:26PM (PDT)"," "
